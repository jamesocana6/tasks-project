#### Organize your thoughts and ideas on a to-do list app with quotes and questions to keep you motivated and reflective. 

## Description
A conglomeration of newly learned skills. Showcased in a simple to-do list app. Change the layout's theme and try out dark mode. This app was created as a test of my ability to think through the logic of a website and styling. So far, could use improvement in both!
